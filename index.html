    <ul>

        <li>Internal-by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External-by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS,is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However, <span>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>

        <p>when comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple element ID,on the other hand , applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and its used by JavaScript.</p>
        <p>In CSS selectors are used to target specific element or range of element on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of style can to the element.</p>
        <p>There is wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID . Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
